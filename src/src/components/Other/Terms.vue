                <p>These are the Terms and Conditions governing the use of this Service and the agreement that operates between “you” and “the team”, as defined herein. These Terms and Conditions set out the rights and obligations of all users regarding the use of this “Service”.</p>
                <p><span>I. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</span></p>
                <p>This website is owned and operated by the team (several developers) in North America. These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”), as well as the copy of the website, may from time to time refer to Metaverse-DAO, principals, members, agents and/or assignees, using terms such as “we”, “us”, or the possessive form, “our”, to refer to the team. The team offers this website, including all of the information hereon,</p>
                <p>(referred to herein as the “Service”) conditionally upon “your” (defined as the user, purchaser or other actor accessing this website) accepting these Terms and Conditions in their entirety.</p>
                <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you disagree with any part of these Terms and Conditions then you may not access the Service.</p>
                <p>The team disclaims and all liability, of whatever form or nature, pertaining to any and all actions the user may take on or through the Service. This includes but is not limited to the purchase, sale, swap, use or possession of METADAO (the “coin”). By taking any action using this website in any manner, you forever waive any complaint, cause of action or other claim of any kind, as to any damages of any kind, including but not limited to economic loss.</p>
                <p>By using this website you forever waive any complaint, cause of action or other claim of any kind as to the integrity, functionality, smooth operation or durability of the computer code that makes up Metaverse-DAO. The team hereby disclaims any and all liability stemming from any fault, flaw, bug or defect in the subject code. The team disclaims any and all liability pertaining to any malfunction in any network over which the coin functions or is transferred,</p>
                <p>and has no control over the decisions or actions of third parties that may or may not interact with, facilitate transactions in, or otherwise support the coin. The team disclaims any and all liability pertaining to any malicious activity that compromises the code or which results in the loss or destruction of the coin, or which otherwise harms the user in any manner.</p>
                <p><span>II. PRIVACY</span></p>
                <p>The Service is for informational purposes only. There is no means or mechanism for providing personal information of any kind to us, or for creating an account with us. To the extent you contact us or forward us information in any manner, such information will be kept confidential and not sold, leased or otherwise provided to any third party. The team,</p>
                <p>however, offers no promises of any kind that it will act on any inquiry or information that you send to us, as there is no central office, customer support or other means of communicating with us as to any issue you may encounter with the Service or the coin.</p>
                
                
                <p><span>III. ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY</span></p>
                <p>Metaverse-DAO exists for entertainment purposes only. The team makes no warranties or representations whatsoever that the coin will continue to exist, or that it will be maintained or upgraded at any point in the future. You should be aware that anything of value that you choose to spend, pledge, swap or otherwise sell or exchange to acquire the coin can be lost in</p>
                <p>its entirety. The team does not offer the coin as a “securities offering”, private placement, or other form of investment. You should not purchase or otherwise interact with the coin if you have any expectation of profit therefrom. You are hereby advised that there is no management, sales, marketing or other team within the team whose efforts you may rely</p>
                <p>on in any manner with respect to the coin or its present or future success.</p>
                <p>You should consult your own financial advisor(s) prior to engaging in any activity through the Service, or with respect to the coin, and you assume all risk of loss or damage that may occur as a result of your choices or decision to interact with the coin in any manner. The team has no control over, nor does it make any representations or warranties, that either the team or any third-party exchange or service, whether centralized or decentralized, wherever it may be in the world, will support or continue to support the coin, make a market in the coin, or otherwise support the transferability or marketability of the coin.</p>
                <p>The team does not control the accumulation or distribution of the coin by any person or party other than coins it may or may not hold at any given time. You are encouraged to be very familiar with how to track or evaluate transactions in the coin yourself, using publicly-available tools such as https://bscscan.com/ or otherwise before interacting with the coin. You should be aware that large transactions in the coin can negatively affect the coin, economically or otherwise. We urge you not to use the Service, or purchase or interact with the coin in any manner, if you do not have an advanced and sophisticated understanding of “cryptocurrency” as it is known by any name, including but not limited to “virtual currency”, “tokens” or “coins”.</p>
                <p><span>IV. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”, “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS</span></p>
                <p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the team, on its own behalf and on behalf of any affiliate and/or their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or</p>
                <p>otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the team provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
                
               
                <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the team nor any of the team 's providers make any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy,</p>
                <p>reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the team are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
                <p>The Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by the team. The team has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites, companies or services. You further acknowledge and agree that the team shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in</p>
                <p>connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services. We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that you visit.</p>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the team or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to</p>
                <p>the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
                <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you. In such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
                <p><span>V. GOVERNING LAW / PERMITTED USERS</span></p>
                <p>The laws of the United States, and the state of Wyoming, shall govern these Terms and Conditions. You are solely responsible for compliance with the laws of any other country that may apply to your use of the Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to the United States government embargo, or</p>
                <p>that has been designated by the United States government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and (ii) you are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You hereby represent and warrant that you are not employed by or hold any position with any governmental body. You further represent that you are over the age of 18. The team does not permit those under 18 to use the Service.</p>
                <p><span>VI. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</span></p>
                
                
                <p>Without limiting any of the foregoing or following provisions of these Terms and Conditions, you and the Company agree that any dispute that cannot be resolved amicably shall be submitted to binding arbitration in lieu of an action before any court. The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association
                (“AAA”) rules, as modified by this Agreement, which shall take place in Cheyenne Wyoming, unless the Parties mutually agree otherwise. This arbitration provision shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law. An arbitrator may not award relief in excess of or contrary to what these Terms and Conditions
                provide, or order consolidation or arbitration on a class wide or representative basis, except that the arbitrator may award damages required by statute on an individual basis and may order injunctive or declaratory relief pursuant to an applicable consumer protection statute.</p>
                <p>Any arbitration determination or award shall be confidential, and neither Party may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the same. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction. All administrative fees and expenses will be divided equally between the Parties, though each Party will bear its own expense of counsel, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration. <span>IF FOR ANY REASON THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE IS DEEMED INAPPLICABLE OR INVALID, THE PARTIES WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIMS ON A CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.</span> No action, regardless of form,
                arising out of or in conjunction with the subject matter of these Terms and Conditions, may be brought by either Party more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.</p>

                <p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 300 days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>
                <H2>BINDING ARBITRATION</H2>
                <p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</p>
                
                <p>The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.</p>
                
                <p>Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. [If such costs are determined to by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.]</p>
                
                <p>The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party.</p>
                
                <p>The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in the location of our choosing,</p>
                
                <p>Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
                
                <p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in [name of county] County, [name of state], and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.</p>
                
                <p>Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms and Conditions.</p>
                
                <p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than 1 year after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
                <H2>OPTION 3: BINDING ARBITRATION</H2>
